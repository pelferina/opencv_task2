Amazon Picking Challenge Task 2

Task: Using OpenCV and the provided set of pictures:
      Part 1: identify matching features between the four (img1.jpg, img2.jpg, img3.jpg, and img4.jpg) images (see the OpenCV FLANN feature matcher for inspiration) and draw the correspondences between the features. 
      Part2: Following that, use the four corner checkerboards in img5.jpg to produce an image like img6.jpg, where the image is cropped to the centers of the checkerboards and projected to be 960x540 pixels. 
As with task 1, you must use C++ or Python to complete this task (C++ prefered).

Deliverable: The "results" folder contains the deliverables

How to Run Program: ./AmazonPickingChallengeTask2 [part1TextFileName] [part2TextFileName] [dirToSaveFinalImages]

partXTextFileName is a .txt file specifying which images are meant for part 1 and which images are meant for part 2

dirToSaveImages is the directory path where the deliverables are to be stored
